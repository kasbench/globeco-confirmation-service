# Cursor Log

## 2025-05-28 - Initial Project Setup and Implementation
- Reviewed and enhanced requirements.md with comprehensive error handling, performance requirements, and validation rules
- Implemented complete clean architecture structure with domain models, services, and utilities
- Created comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Fixed Docker build configuration and service startup issues
- Implemented Kafka consumer with proper logging and error handling

## 2025-05-28 - JSON Parsing Fix for Scientific Notation and Null Values
- **Issue**: Service was failing to parse JSON responses from execution service due to scientific notation (0E-8) and null values for averagePrice field
- **Root Cause**: Standard JSON unmarshaling couldn't handle scientific notation for int64 fields and null values for float64 fields
- **Solution**: Added custom JSON unmarshaling for ExecutionResponse struct with helper functions parseToInt64() and parseToFloat64()
- **Changes**: Modified AveragePrice field to *float64 pointer type to handle null values properly
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive tests for scientific notation parsing and null value handling
- **Result**: Service now successfully processes execution service responses with scientific notation and null values

## 2025-05-28 - PUT Response JSON Parsing Fix
- **Issue**: PUT requests to execution service were failing with 500 status code due to JSON parsing errors in ExecutionUpdateResponse
- **Root Cause**: ExecutionUpdateResponse struct didn't have custom JSON unmarshaling like ExecutionResponse, causing same scientific notation and null value issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Added custom JSON unmarshaling to ExecutionUpdateResponse struct
  - Changed AveragePrice field from float64 to *float64 pointer type
  - Updated test cases to use pointer values with helper function float64Ptr()
  - Fixed validation service test that had incorrect expected error message for execution status validation
- **Changes**:
  - Modified ExecutionUpdateResponse.AveragePrice to pointer type
  - Added comprehensive tests for ExecutionUpdateResponse JSON parsing
  - Fixed test expectation from "PENDING, PARTIAL, FULL, CANCELLED" to actual FIX protocol statuses "NEW, SENT, WORK, PART, FULL, HOLD, CNCL, CNCLD, CPART, DEL"
- **Result**: Service now successfully handles both GET and PUT responses from execution service with scientific notation and null values, all tests passing

Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Adding error handling requirements, performance requirements, validation requirements, fixing execution plan order, and enhancing clarity

Request: Start executing the plan with step 1
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 1 - Project Initialization and Repository Setup (Go module, directory structure, dependencies)

Request: Proceed with Step 2
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 2 - Domain Models and DTOs (Kafka fill messages, Execution Service API DTOs, domain models)

Request: Proceed with Step 3
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 3 - Configuration Management (Viper-based config system with validation and environment support)

Request: Proceed with Step 4
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 4 - Logging and Observability Foundation (structured logging, metrics, tracing, correlation IDs)

Request: Proceed with Step 5
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 5 - Error Handling and Resilience Strategy (retry mechanism, circuit breaker, dead letter queue)

Request: Proceed with Step 6

Request: Please proceed to the next step
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Implementing Step 9 - Middleware and Utilities (additional time/data utilities, comprehensive middleware testing, enhanced utility functions)

Request: Fix Docker build error in CI/CD pipeline
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Fixed Dockerfile to build correct confirmation-service instead of fix-engine, updated paths and port from 8080 to 8086

Request: Can you confirm that I have @config.yaml in the correct directory to be picked up in the build
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Confirmed config.yaml is correctly located in root directory for local development, identified missing config file copy in Dockerfile and fixed it

Request: When I run the service, I'm not seeing this statement in the log and I can see no evidence that the consumer is running. Please confirm the consumer is started when the service runs.
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Fixed missing Kafka consumer initialization in main.go - replaced TODO comments with actual service startup code, fixed interface mismatches, confirmed consumer now starts and logs "Starting Kafka consumer" message

Request: Please fix
Date: 2025-01-27
Action: Fixed test failure by updating MockKafkaConsumer.Stop method signature to match the updated KafkaConsumerInterface (added context.Context parameter), all tests now pass
